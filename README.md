## Development

### Backend

We are going to use the node.js for the RESTful API and using the PostgreSQL as the database. Currently, we'll use the Python 3.x to develop the crawler. The crawler will try to fetch the artists, albums and tracks from the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), and the music video from the [YouTube.com](http://www.youtube.com/). Once the data is enough, we'll define the RESTful API.


### Front-end

We'll use the AngularJS2 to develop the front-end.
